NOTE: All ingredients in this list may be purchasable from the supermarket but they are necessary reagents for growing bacteria / mold. They’re not meant for humans, so to prevent contamination **don’t mix it with your own food**.  
Also, don't bring food into FabCafe MTRL's bio lab.

1. Wash the flask with dish washing liquid and rinse very very well with water. 
2. Wash your hands and clean the table with alcohol. Don’t forget to tie back long hair!
3. Prepare the reagents. We referred to [this recipe](https://biohackacademy.github.io/bha4/cultivation-media/nutrient-agar/) by BioHack Academy.

4. Measure the reagents with the **oldest** scale you can find.

   A total solution of 450ml was more than we needed for 10 petri dishes, but it made it easier to weigh the dry ingredients on an analog scale.
  * ~~Dry yeast~~ Marmite 0.9g 
  * Protein powder 2.25g
  * Salt 2.25g
  * Agar powder 6.75g 
  * Demi water 450ml  
5. Pour reagents into the flask, cover it with aluminium foil and mix it well by swirling it.

6. Remove the aluminium foil, put the flask in the microwave and warm it up at a low setting. Every 20~30 seconds or so, take it out with an oven mitt, swirl it and continue warming it. Stop when it comes to a boil.

7. Cover the flask with aluminium foil and wait for it too cool down to about 50-60℃.  
Or if you’re impatient like us, insert the flask into cold water. Just be careful that it doesn't solidify.

8. After the agar has cooled down, pour them into the petri dishes. While hovering the lid over the petri dish swiftly pour in the agar until the dish is half full and close the lid. Wait for the agar to solidify.

9. As you wait, throw some left over agar against the window. Will it stick? Let’s try and see.

10. Use a clean cotton swab to collect samples. If possible dampen it with distilled water beforehand.  

11. When the agar is nice and solid, streak your samples on the agar. Hover the lid over the petri dish, swiftly streak the plate by gently rubbing the cotton swab on the agar (like [this](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=streaking+agar&safe=active&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXqfydudXSAhUGG5QKHSGzBG0Q_AUICCgB&biw=1387&bih=776)) and close the lid. 

12. Make sure to write the date and where you collected your samples from on the petri dish.

13. If you’re collecting samples from different places write that down too.

14. Seal the dishes with parafilm. This film will prevent contaminants from entering and preserve the moisture in the petri dish.  
   <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130922490@N08/33416812775/in/album-72157677327943603/" title="week07-14"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3791/33416812775_aab89fa373.jpg" width="425" height="319" alt="week07-14"></a>  
12. Keep the petri dishes in an incubator at 30℃. Make sure to flip them upside-down (The agar side is on top). We don’t want the condensation on the lid to drip on the agar.

15. Now let’s watch the microbes grow. Don’t forget to take pictures of the process. And once things start to grow don’t open the lid.

16. When you are done with your dish, sterilise the agar in an autoclave or pour some bleach into the petri dish before disposal.

Unused dishes sealed with parafilm can be preserved in the fridge for about a week. Make sure it is warmed to room temperature before use.
